    <string name="challenge_description">Regularly walking is one of the simplest and best exercises for boosting physical and mental wellbeing. Not to mention having a significantly lower risk of producing any injuries, especially when compared to high impact exercises such as running.
        \n\nTo fully reap the health benefits of cutting excess fat and building stamina, try walking at a brisk pace â€“ around 3mph. If you can still talk but cannot sing the words to a song, then you are at the perfect pace.
